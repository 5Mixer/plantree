# plantree
why not make a game about planting trees with friends in a couple of hours I mean it can't hurt right

# but mixer, I don't have time to clone, build and host a server
good thing I already have! http://dandoes.tech/plantree/build/html5/

# but the players and trees look different across clients?
you're welcome to contribute

# why the lack of caps?
i think it's hipster? dunno. this project doesn't warrant caps

# what's it made with?
the haxe programming language, mphx multiplayer library and kha library for controls/window.

# who are you?
a fellow tree planter

# there isn't very much room to plant trees
find a real garden

# it's not very realistic
join a gardening club

# your tree's look terrible
go outside

# i don't like gardening
don't play

# i like gardening
yay plant trees

# this readme sucks
plant trees.

# tree's are not persistent
that's why we must keep planting trees
